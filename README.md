## Projects

### Credit Scoring Engine for a Digital Lending Platform

- **Tools/Frameworks:** AWS Services, FastAPI, Docker, MLflow, Kubeflow, feast
- **What it does:** Developed an alternative data-driven credit scoring and configurable decisioning platform for short-tenure loan products. Implemented and deployed multiple machine learning models, establishing fully automated MLOps pipelines for seamless integration and operational efficiency.
- **Evaluation of stability:** Monitored accuracy, performance metrics, and robustness to data shifts and noise. Successfully processed over 1,000,000 requests with response times consistently under 1 second, serving a user base of 60,000 unique customers over a one-year period.

### Implementation of Datalake and Analytics Tool for Financial Report Data

- **Tools/Frameworks:** Redash, AWS Services (S3, EC2, RDS, Lambda), Kedro
- **What it does:** Developed an ETL pipeline for an edutech company to extract over six years of financial report data and integrate it with their ledger software. Built analytics dashboards to provide actionable insights into financial activities.
- **Usability:** Enabled a 30% increase in user adoption of financial analytics dashboards and reports, leading to a 25% reduction in time spent on data retrieval and analysis.

### End-to-End Monitoring and Evaluation (M & E) KPI Metadata Mapping Data Pipeline

- **Tools/Frameworks:** AWS Services (S3, EC2, RDS, Lambda), Kedro
- **What it does:** Developed an ETL pipeline for an edutech company to extract their 3-year OKR planning data and integrate it with available resources. Implemented semantic keyphrase embedding and graph techniques to resolve hierarchical-based conceptual data mapping and grouping challenges. Built analytics dashboards for actionable insights into KPI and OKR mapping.
- **Impact:** Enabled a 15% increase in user adoption of KPI and OKR mapping analytics dashboards and reports, with a 10% reduction in time spent on monitoring progress against objectives.

### Personalized Document Support Conversational Bot

- **Tools/Frameworks:** Langchain, FastAPI, JavaScript
- **What it does:** Integrated OpenAI GPT-3.5 API for document-based question answering, improving accessibility and usability of financial reports and analytics insights. Utilized Langchain with FastAPI and JavaScript to enable natural language interaction, simplifying complex financial data for actionable insights.

### Event and Temporal Information Extraction from Amharic Text

- **Tools/Frameworks:** Python, LSTM, TensorFlow
- **What it does:** Developed methods to extract event and temporal information from Amharic text. Constructed a dataset of unstructured temporal-triggered news headlines in Amharic. Addressed challenges in disambiguating deverbal nominal entities through rule-based approaches and classical ML models.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

## Learn More

You can learn more in the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).
